# Tasks: 多Agent加密货币量化交易分析系统

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-python-llm-agent/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/api.yaml

**Tests**: 测试任务包含在每个用户故事中，因为系统需要高可靠性保证

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Backend + Mobile**: `backend/src/`, `mobile/src/`

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-7)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3 → P4 → P5)
- **Polish (Phase 8)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent of US1
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational - May reuse US2 technical analysis components
- **User Story 4 (P1)**: Can start after US1, US2, US3 - Depends on all analysis results
- **User Story 5 (P1)**: Can start after US4 - Depends on strategy generation

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD approach for high reliability)
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, User Stories 1, 2, and 3 can start in parallel (different team members)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for news collection endpoint in tests/contract/test_news.py"
Task: "Integration test for news collection workflow in tests/integration/test_news_workflow.py"
Task: "Unit test for news filtering logic in tests/unit/test_news_filter.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create NewsData model in backend/src/models/news.py"
Task: "Create NewsSummary model in backend/src/models/news_summary.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1, 2, 4, 5 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (News Collection)
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Long Analysis)
5. Complete Phase 6: User Story 4 (Strategy Generation)
6. Complete Phase 7: User Story 5 (Trading Execution)
7. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test core trading workflow independently
8. Deploy/demo core functionality

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (News capability)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Long analysis)
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Short analysis)
5. Add User Story 4 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Complete strategy generation)
6. Add User Story 5 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (Full trading system)
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (News Collection)
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (Long Analysis)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (Short Analysis)
3. Developer A continues to User Story 4 (Strategy Generation - needs all analysis results)
4. Developer B continues to User Story 5 (Trading Execution)
5. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing (TDD approach for high reliability)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- This is a high-reliability trading system - tests and validation are mandatory
- LLM and exchange API failures must be handled gracefully
- Security and monitoring are critical for production deployment
